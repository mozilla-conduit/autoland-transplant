    """Replace changesets with new versions.

    This is a generic function used to perform history rewriting.

    Given an iterable of input nodes, a function will be called which is
    expected to produce a new changeset to replace the input node. The
    function signature should be:

        def createfn(repo, ctx, revmap, copyfilectxfn):

    It is passed a repo, the changectx being rewritten, a map of old to new
    revisions that have been changed so far, and a function that can be used
    as the memctx callback for obtaining memfilectx when no file modifications
    are to be performed (a common pattern). The function should return an
    *uncommitted* memctx holding the new changeset info.

    We currently restrict that the createfn callback must return a new
    changeset and that no file changes may occur. Restricting file changes
    satisfies the requirements this function was invented for and keeps the
    implementation simple.

    After the memctx is obtained, it is committed. Children changesets are
    rebased automatically after all changesets have been rewritten.

    After the old to new mapping is obtained, bookmarks are moved and old
    changesets are made obsolete or stripped, depending on what is appropriate
    for the repo configuration.

    This function handles locking the repository and performing as many actions
    in a transaction as possible.

    Before any changes are made, we verify the state of the repo is sufficient
    for transformation to occur and abort otherwise.
